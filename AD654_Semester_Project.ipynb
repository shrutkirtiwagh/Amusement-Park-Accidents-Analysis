Additionally, parks can use this data to identify areas where improvements in safety measures may be necessary."

        "One important factor to note here is the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the earnings of both Hyatt and Hilton. Being hotels, there was a big hit to revenue in 2020 and 2021, which then turned into negative or low earnings due to both of their high-fixed costs of physical locations. With that being said, earnings were relatively normal in 2022, so we felt that for Hilton the CAGR for all four years worked. For Hyatt, however, their 2022 earnings were lower than 2019, but had a positive trend from 2021, so we decided to only use net income from 2021 to 2022. This year over year growth was very abrupt, so we decided to halve that growth rate to have more realistic projections for the next three years. The final numbers are expressed in millions of dollars.\n"
